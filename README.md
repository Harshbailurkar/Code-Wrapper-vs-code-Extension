## Features

The Wrapper HTML extension allows you to effortlessly wrap your HTML code with any common HTML wrapping tags like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and more. No more manually searching for ending tagsâ€”this extension takes care of it for you!

## Usage

1. Select the HTML code you want to wrap.
2. Trigger the extension by using the default keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+1` or through the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) by typing `Wrap HTML Element`.
3. Choose your desired wrapping tag from the quick pick list.

## Extension Settings

If the default keybinding conflicts with another extension, you can customize it by adding the following to your `keybindings.json` file:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "ctrl+1", // your_custom_key
        "command": "html-wrapper-.wrapper",
        "when": "editorTextFocus"
    }
]
```
### Known Issues
Currently, the extension fully supports wrapping elements with a range of block-level tags. Future updates will include enhanced support for additional tags.

## Release Notes
